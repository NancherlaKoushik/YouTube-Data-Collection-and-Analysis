# 📊 YouTube Trending Videos Analysis (US)

This project explores and analyzes the **Top 200 Trending YouTube Videos in the United States** using the **YouTube Data API v3**. The notebook automates data collection, cleans and transforms the dataset, and performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in content engagement and trends.

---

## 🧠 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Understand what kind of videos are trending on YouTube in the US.
- Analyze various metrics such as **view count**, **like count**, **comment count**, **video duration**, **tags**, and **channel information**.
- Identify which features contribute to higher engagement.
- Prepare the data for further modeling or trend analysis if desired.

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset is generated dynamically using the **YouTube Data API v3**. For each trending video, the following information is extracted:

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `video_id` | Unique ID of the video |
| `title` | Video title |
| `description` | Video description |
| `publishedAt` | Publish date and time |
| `channelId` | Channel's unique ID |
| `channelTitle` | Channel name |
| `tags` | Video tags (keywords) |
| `duration` | ISO 8601 video duration |
| `definition` | Video quality (e.g., hd/sd) |
| `caption` | Availability of subtitles |
| `viewCount` | Number of views |
| `likeCount` | Number of likes |
| `commentCount` | Number of comments |
| `favoriteCount` | (Deprecated by YouTube API) |
| `categoryId` | Numeric ID representing video category |

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **YouTube Data API v3**
- **Pandas** for data handling
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Google API Client** for fetching video data

---

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youtube-trending-analysis.git
cd youtube-trending-analysis
```

### 2. Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn google-api-python-client
```

### 3. Get a YouTube API Key

- Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/)
- Create a new project and enable **YouTube Data API v3**
- Generate an **API Key**

### 4. Add API Key to Notebook

Open `ya.ipynb` and replace the placeholder text in the cell where the API is initialized:

```python
DEVELOPER_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

---

## 🚀 Running the Notebook

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook ya.ipynb
   ```
2. Run all the cells sequentially to:
   - Fetch video data
   - Store it in a Pandas DataFrame
   - Clean and analyze the dataset
   - Save the output to `trending_videos.csv`

---

## 📊 Data Analysis Performed

- **Data Cleaning**
  - Converted `publishedAt` to `datetime` type
  - Handled missing `description` values
  - Processed `tags` from list strings to readable format

- **Data Distribution Visualizations**
  - Histogram of `viewCount`, `likeCount`, `commentCount`
  - Boxplot of engagement metrics
  - Correlation heatmaps

- **Content & Metadata Exploration**
  - Duration vs Engagement
  - Quality (`definition`) vs Views
  - Caption availability vs Comments
  - Channel popularity distribution

---



---

## 📂 Output Files

- **`trending_videos.csv`** – The cleaned dataset containing all fetched video data.
- **Plots/Charts** – Embedded within the notebook or exportable to `images/` folder.

---

## 📌 Observations

- **Skewed Distribution**: Engagement metrics like views and likes are heavily right-skewed.
- **Content Tags**: Many trending videos share popular tags (e.g., “official”, “trailer”, “music”).
- **Video Quality**: Most trending videos are in HD.
- **Subtitles**: Caption availability has limited impact on trending status.

---

## 🧪 Future Enhancements

- Perform **sentiment analysis** on video titles/descriptions.
- Classify trending categories and predict **what will trend next**.
- Automate periodic fetching (daily/weekly) and create a live dashboard.
